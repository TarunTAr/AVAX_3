* I made a Three functions of mint , burn and transfer in a such a way that if I mint a token then the  Balance should be increase with the amount and the initial amount will be decreased by the amount.
* For Burn :  Function that is if I want to burn the token then it will decrease by the mint amount and it is increased by the initial amount and whenever I have to transfer the token to the another address then it will burn means it will decrease with the amount that token transferred to another address.
